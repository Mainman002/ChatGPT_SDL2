# ChatGPT_SDL2
An SDL2 project generated mostly by ChatGPT (guided a lot by me fixing things though)

## Dependancies needed to run this projects
* gcc
* sdl2
* sdl2_image

If you're on macos then you can install using brew
```
brew install sdl2 sdl2_image
```
Thos files should be found in
```
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/sdl2/2.26.5/include
```
For simplicity I just coppied 
```
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/sdl2_image/2.6.3_1/include
```
into
```
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/sdl2/2.26.5/
```
